# KiCon 2019 badge SAO Adapter

This simple board allows you to mount SAO compatible addons to your KiCon 2019 badge.

It's following v1.69bis of the #shittyadon standard, and to fully compliant, you should
use a 2x3 pin female conneector that has a key, pointing up.

I have made shared projects at Aisler (same green and gold color and quality as the badge itself) and OSH Park (purple and gold)
